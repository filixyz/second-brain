## 2.2.1 Overview of HTTP
The Hyper-Text Transfer protocol is the web’s application layer protocol. HTTP is implemented by two programs; a client (browser) and the server (web server), each operating on different end systems. They communicate with each other exchanging HTTP messages.

A web page is simply a document with multiple objects, an object is a file like video, jpeg or html text. most web pages consist of base html and numerous referenced objects. The referencing is done via URL.

A URL consists of two components: the host-name of the server that houses the object and its path-name.
```http
http://www.hostname.com/path/to/file.jpeg
```
HTTP define how web clients request web pages from web servers.

HTTP uses TCP as its underlying transport protocol. The HTTP client first initiates a TCP connection with the server. 
Then the client process uses its socket interface to relay requests to the server process and receives responses via that same socket, same analogy goes with the server process and it’s socket interface.

The HTTP web server and client browser relationship is a stateless one; meaning that HTTP connections typically do not store historical information pertaining to past messages exchanges between it’s servers and clients. It simply handles its current task, completes its and forgets about it within a connection and moves to the next task.

Hence its a **stateless protocol**.

## 2.2.2 Non Persistent and Persistent Connections
**Persistent TCP connections** are connections in which conversing end systems perform series of requests within the same TCP connection (multiple requests under one TCP connection).

**Non-Persistent TCP connections** are connections in which conversing end systems perform series request within each of their own TCP connection (one request for one TCP connection).

HTTP can be implemented to choose which over of the both.

**RTT**; Round Trip Time is the time elapsed from when a client makes a requests till when it actually receives the content it requested for from a server.
It can also be defined as the time taken for a small packet to travel from client to server and then back to the client.


## 2.2.3 HTTP Message Format
The HTTP specifications `[RFC 1945; RFC 7230; RFC 7540]` include the definitions of the HTTP message formats. There are two types of HTTP messages, request messages and responses messages.

### HTTP Request Message
This is a typical HTTP request message:
```http
GET /somedir/page.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.someschool.edu
Connection: close
User-agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept-language: fr
```
This is written in ordinary ASCII text and each line is followed by a carriage return and a line feed.

The first line is called the **request line** and subsequent lines are called **header lines**.
The request line has three fields:
1) the method field
2) the URL field and,
3) HTTP version field.
The method field can take several different values including `GET, POST, HEAD, PUT and DELETE`.

In the header lines we can see the `Host` field line that specified the host in which the GET request will be transmitted to. One might think that this header lines are unnecessary, due to the fact that for a client to be able to send messages it must had already established a TCP connection with the host address previously supplied.

But this information provided by header lines are required by web proxy caches. 

Here are some header lines and their meaning:
1)  `Connection: close` header line tells the server that we don’t want to bother with persistent connections; close connection after requested object has been sent
2) `User-agent: ` Specifies the user agent like Mozilla (typically the browser)
3) `Accept-Language:` The preferred language to receive a web object.

different HTML commands:
1) `GET`: retrieves a web object
2) `POST`: retrieves a web object with some specified parameters (multiple)
3) `HEAD`: retrieves HTTP message without entity body (basically only the header lines); used for quantification (and possibly qualification) of a web object. Used in debugging.
4) `PUT`: uploads a web object
5) `DELETE`: deletes object on a web server.

### HTTP Response Message
Typical HTTP response message:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Date: Tue, 18 Aug 2015 15:44:04 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOs)
Last-Modified: Tue, 18 Aug 2015 15:11:03 GMT
Content-Length: 6821
Content-Type: text/html

(data data data data data ...)
```
The first line is the **status line**, the following six lines are  **header lines** and the last is the **entity body**.

The entity body is the meat of the message; the actual data we requested for.

The status line is composed of two fields: the protocol version, status code and corresponding status message. The rest are really self explanatory. The content length is in bytes.

Here are some common status codes with their associated phrases included:
1) `200 OK`: Request succeeded and information is returned in the response
2) `301 Moved Permanently`: Requested object has been permanently moved; new URL  attached to the `Location:` header of the response message. 
3) `400 Bad Request`: Request could not be understood
4) `404 Not Found`: Requested document does not exist on this server
5) `505 HTTP Version Not Supported:` Requested HTTP protocol version is not supported by the server.
