A typical network application consists of a pair of programs; a client application residing at the client end-system and a server application residing at the servers end system.

When this programs are executed the client and server process are created, and these process communicate with each other by reading from and writing to sockets.

There are two types of network applications:
1) **Protocol standard implementation**; the RFC’s (Revisions for Comments) protocols, they are referred to as open protocols.
2) **Proprietary network applications**; in this case clients and servers employ an application layer protocol not standardized by the RFC, openly published elsewhere. This protocols are not open protocols because they don't provide a standardization that other can use to implement the protocol.
