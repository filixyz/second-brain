What does it mean to design for concurrency? This basically means that multiple threads can access the data structure concurrently,either performing the same operations or distinct operations and each thread will see a self-consistent view of the data structure; Meaning no data is lost, no invariants broken and no problematic race conditions.

Serialization: in which due to the exclusive nature of ownership, by a mutex, a data structure must be bounded by to enable safe concurrent access, threads take turns accessing the data protected by that mutex, if the granularity of the access is too large, it could degrade the access to the data structure from a concurrent one to a sequential one.

So the idea for building efficient data structures for concurrent access is simple: the smaller the protected region, the fewer operations are serialized, and the greater the potential for concurrency.

### Guidelines for designing data structures for concurrency
There are two aspects to consider when designing data structures for concurrent access: Ensuring that the access are safe and enabling genuine concurrent access.

The basics of how data structure can be thread-safe were discussed back in chapter 3:
* Ensure that no thread can see a state where the invariants of the data structure have been broken by the actions of another thread.
* Take care to avoid race conditions inherent in the interface to the data structure by providing functions for complete operations rather than for operation steps.
* Pay attention to how the data structure behaves in the presence of exceptions to ensure that the invariants are not broken.
* Minimize the opportunities for deadlock when using the data structure by restricting the scope of locks and avoiding nested locks where possible.
